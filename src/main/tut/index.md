XML utilities library.

The primary goal of the library is to support round-trip parsing from XML source to parsed Scala objects and back to XML data.

Currently implemented:  collecting text contents from XML sources.

See [API docs](api/edu/holycross/shot/xmlutils/index.html) for version **1.0.0**.
